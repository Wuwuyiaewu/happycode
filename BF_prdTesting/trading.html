                            economic news that hides the market
                            action, and a trading platform to monetize that information. The question is,
                            how not to fall into the pitfalls of ‘fear’ and ‘greed’, but rather understanding
                            that these are the passions that move the markets.</p>

                            we know when the market is panicking and why? How can we take advantage
                            of the herd mentality without becoming
                            a member of the herd? In short – how can we bank wisely on the trends that
                            fear and greed create?</p>

                            easy, but it’s worth money in the short run, and
                            self-assurance later on. Strangely, though, the steps you can take are – in
                            themselves – quite simple.</p>

                                    incorporate a huge number of people around the world just like
                                    you, watching
                                    what happens, hoping to make a profit, panicking when they don’t. Examples of market
                                    failures
                                    are abundant, and what most of them portray is public mayhem leading to market
                                    chaos.</p>
                                <p class="text-16 text-gray-5a5 whitespace-pre-line">In 1929, the greed of private
                                    investors caused a boom and panic caused the crash; in 2008,
                                    bankers monopolized on human greed, then crashed on their own personal fear. In
                                    short, and
                                    despite accepted theories regarding so-called “efficient markets” – if anything

                                    about the algo-trading going on between emotionless computers,
                                    but remember who programs them. Computers may be impassive, but their programmers
                                    make
                                    mistakes, cause flash crashes and more.</p>

                            While you probably can’t
                            afford an algo-trading mainframe, you can learn about your emotions, how to identify them,
                            and extrapolate that to the market.</p>

                                beginners make mistakes, no matter what they’re undertaking. Ever
                                heard those first recordings by the Beatles? Seen the kiddie movies Spielberg made with
                                his first Super-8? But everyone learns, and mistakes are a part of the learning process.

                            <p class="text-16 text-gray-5a5 whitespace-pre-line leading-36px">The first rule of trading
                                is “never risk more than you can afford to lose”. This is not to say
                                that financial trading is a losing endeavour (after all, why are all those traders into
                                it?), but
                                one must be prepared to lose almost constantly at first. Just like any other kind of
                                occupation, nobody comes into it fully fledged and bursting with potential.</p>
                            <p class="text-16 text-gray-5a5 whitespace-pre-line leading-36px">Markets must be learned,
                                and that is a time-consuming occupation. Thus, besides making
                                sure you can afford to lose any pre-determined amount of money at the beginning, it is
                                also a good idea to know how to spread that amount out.</p>

                                Is there a formula?</h3>
                            <p class="text-16 text-gray-5a5 whitespace-pre-line leading-36px">Roughly, there are 2 rules
                                to determine the ratio of capital to total open trades and
                                investment per trade. These are the 2/10 rule and the 5/20 rule, usually
                                ascribed to Warren Buffet. The 2/10 rule is for beginners, and it quite simply states

                                more than 2% of one’s entire portfolio should be invested in any
                                one position, and no more than 10% in all open positions at any one time.</p>
                            <p class="text-16 text-gray-5a5 whitespace-pre-line leading-36px">Thus, if you have invested
                                $1000 in your account, no position should have been initiated
                                with more than $20, and your entire sum of assets invested in open
                                positions should never rise above $100 (5 open positions, more or less). The 5/20 rule
                                is
                                aimed at more experienced traders. Second, place your take-profit and stop-loss orders
                                at
                                a ratio of 1:3 – for every dollar you risk losing on an open position, your take profit
                                should
                                be triple.</p>
                            <p class="text-16 text-gray-5a5 whitespace-pre-line leading-36px">Thus, if you stand to lose
                                your $20 investment, your take profit level should ensure you a
                                $60 profit.</p>

                        DIFFERENCE?</h2>
                    <p class="text-16 text-gray-5a5 whitespace-pre-line leading-36px mb-12">You’ve heard this cliché
                        again and again; the answer, in a word, is ‘homework’. Returning once again to every investor’s
                        guru, Mr. Buffet, always remember
                        his secret to success: “I never invest in a company I do not understand.”</p>
                    <div class="leading-36px mb-16">
                        <h3 class="text-16 text-gray-343 leading-none font-OpenSans-ExtraBold whitespace-pre-line mb-2">
                            But Buffet has a huge organization doing research for him. How can I even begin to keep up?
                        </h3>
                        <p class="text-16 text-gray-5a5 whitespace-pre-line">The more you know about an asset, its
                            fundamentals, what makes it tick and what influences its value, the less your position
                            becomes a blind gamble, and
                            the more it becomes an informed investment.</p>
                        <p class="text-16 text-gray-5a5 whitespace-pre-line">Think of those scenes in movies about
                            horse-racing and boxing: they’re always about the “inside tip”, “taking a fall”, the hero
                            trying to maintain the grace of
                            sport in a world of (albeit dishonest) businessmen. The producers may want to tell you that
                            honesty pays; but the reality is, that in the world of business,
                            the more you know, the better positioned you are for success.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="leading-36px mb-15">

                            So what can I do?</h3>
                        <p class="text-16 text-gray-5a5 whitespace-pre-line">Before investing in an asset, study it for
                            an extended period. See how its value changes with every new bit of information. Find out
                            who are the faces
                            behind the decisions. Only when you completely understand the asset should you begin
                            formulating a plan for its monetisation.</p>
                        <p class="text-16 text-gray-5a5 whitespace-pre-line">You may find a company that is making a lot
                            of money, but diverts most of its capital to wages rather than development; you may find one
                            whose stats are
                            impressive, until you compare it to others in its sector; you may find a company that
                            fulfils your dream requirements, but whose CEO has been charged
                            with fraud. In short: don’t invest in what you do not know!</p>
                        <p class="text-16 text-gray-5a5 whitespace-pre-line">Whether you’re a fundamental analyst,
                            studying the news and financial reports, or a technical analyst, verifying technical
                            indicators against one another,
                            it’s always best to investigate the interplay of the two – see how the technical reacts to
                            the fundamentals and (quite often) how often the fundamentals are
                            a reaction to the market.</p>
                        <p class="text-16 text-gray-5a5 whitespace-pre-line">But whatever your approach, stick to it
                            until you reach a point where you see your predictions bearing out. Investigate the past
                            until you understand it,
                            then try to apply what you’ve learned to the present/future.</p>

                    <p class="text-16 text-gray-5a5 whitespace-pre-line leading-36px mb-10">That way, when you lose on a
                        position, you won’t see it as a personal failure but rather a new direction to investigate –
                        another learning opportunity. Search
                        for the point at which your prediction and the market diverged and study it. Only when you learn
                        to put your mistakes to good use will you finally be
                        profiting from them.</p>
                    <p class="text-16 text-gray-5a5 whitespace-pre-line leading-36px">Good luck and welcome to the most
                        fascinating endeavour, ever!</p>
